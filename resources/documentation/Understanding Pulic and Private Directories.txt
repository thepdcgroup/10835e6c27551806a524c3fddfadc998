Understanding Public and Private Directories:

This application is a static website generator. The website is built in /www (aka the web directory). This is what you upload to your webserver. /www/public (aka public directory) is for items accessible by visitors through the website address. /www/private (aka private directory) is for resources accessible by the website, but not the public (e.g. databases, user data, etc). The website generated by this application is static so it does not make use of the private directory. It can be safely deleted, or excluded from uploads to your websever. You can upload the entire application to your webserver, and run it there. However, running it locally is useful for testing purposes.
