Description: This contains content for the the file "/www/public/rel-robots.txt". rel-robots.txt is a robots.txt alternative, that functions the same, except its scope is limited to the current directory, and subdirectories. Its rules overrule anything stated in a robots.txt file. It is not currently supported by third-parties, and therefore has no effect.
