      Education is the process of <strong>learning</strong>. It is a lifelong journey in which individuals acquire knowledge, skills, and values through various methods and experiences. There are three primary types of education: formal, non-formal, and informal.
    </p>
    <h3>Formal Education</h3>
    <p>
      Formal education is a structured and <strong>systematic</strong> approach to learning provided by <strong>accredited</strong> institutions. It typically occurs in <strong>schools</strong> and follows a <strong>standardized</strong> curriculum with a set <strong>syllabus</strong>. Lessons are delivered in a <strong>teacher-led</strong> environment, and learning is organized with <strong>regular</strong> assessments and examinations on a <strong>fixed</strong> schedule.
    </p>
    <h3>Non-formal Education</h3>
    <p>
      Non-formal education offers a more adaptable approach to learning. It is often voluntary and designed to be <strong>flexible</strong> to suit the diverse needs of learners. This form of education commonly takes place in <strong>community</strong> settings and employs <strong>interactive</strong> teaching methods. Programs may include <strong>vocational</strong> training and emphasize <strong>practical</strong> skill development, adapting to each learner's <strong>individual</strong> needs while providing <strong>diverse</strong> opportunities. Additionally, many online courses, such as MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) and professional development courses offered by unaccredited institutions, are categorized as non-formal education. Although these courses do not follow traditional accreditation systems, they deliver flexible, interactive, and often self-paced learning experiences that support professional growth and lifelong learning.
    </p>
    <h3>Informal Education</h3>
    <p>
      Informal education occurs outside of formal settings and is characterized by its spontaneous, <strong>experiential</strong> nature. It is a <strong>self-directed</strong> process where learning happens naturally through everyday <strong>interactions</strong> and activities. Often, this type of education is <strong>incidental</strong> and driven by an <strong>intrinsic</strong> desire to understand and explore. It takes place in <strong>real-world</strong> environments and encourages learners to engage in <strong>creative</strong> inquiry.
