    <h1>An Introduction to Education</h1>
    <p>
      Education is the process of <strong>learning</strong>. It is a lifelong journey in which individuals acquire knowledge, skills, and values through various methods and experiences. There are three primary types of education: formal, non‐formal, and informal.
    </p>
    <h2>Formal Education</h2>
    <p>
      Formal education is a structured and <strong>systematic</strong> approach to learning provided by <strong>accredited</strong> institutions. It typically occurs in <strong>schools</strong> and follows a <strong>standardized</strong> curriculum with a set <strong>syllabus</strong>. Lessons are delivered in a <strong>teacher-led</strong> environment, and learning is organized with <strong>regular</strong> assessments and examinations on a <strong>fixed</strong> schedule.
    </p>
    <h2>Non-formal Education</h2>
    <p>
      Non-formal education offers a more adaptable approach to learning. It is often voluntary and designed to be <strong>flexible</strong> to suit the diverse needs of learners. This form of education commonly takes place in <strong>community</strong> settings and employs <strong>interactive</strong> teaching methods. Programs may include <strong>vocational</strong> training and emphasize <strong>practical</strong> skill development, adapting to each learner’s <strong>individual</strong> needs while providing <strong>diverse</strong> opportunities. Additionally, many online courses, such as MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) and professional development courses offered by unaccredited institutions, are categorized as non‐formal education. Although these courses do not follow traditional accreditation systems, they deliver flexible, interactive, and often self-paced learning experiences that support professional growth and lifelong learning.
    </p>
    <h2>Informal Education</h2>
    <p>
      Informal education occurs outside of formal settings and is characterized by its spontaneous, <strong>experiential</strong> nature. It is a <strong>self-directed</strong> process where learning happens naturally through everyday <strong>interactions</strong> and activities. Often, this type of education is <strong>incidental</strong> and driven by an <strong>intrinsic</strong> desire to understand and explore. It takes place in <strong>real-world</strong> environments and encourages learners to engage in <strong>creative</strong> inquiry.
